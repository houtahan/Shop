The assignment was to create an online shop which handles 3 types of accounts and accesses which are user, seller and
admin. The objectives were to completely understand polymorphism and inheritance and use them in our code.
The programming language used was java and gradle was used as package manager.
The most challenging bug that was faced was : Execution failed for task ':Main.main()'.
                                              > Process 'command 'C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_351/bin/java.exe'' finished with non-zero exit value 1
which was because of the arraylists and the fact that we cant add to them if they are null and this problem was handled
by preventing the arraylists to be null at the moment of creating them.
The testing process was straightforward because you would know what the program must output at any moment and any result
besides that would mean something is not happening completely correctly in the code.
The code I wrote does the main tasks that were presented and also bonus tasks number 4, 7 and 10.
This assignment was a great exercise to learn the principles of java oop and learn to use them.
